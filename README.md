# Command Center

A Python, curses console application I created for my dad, who bravely switched from Windows to Linux but is still deathly afraid of the terminal.

This handy tool offers a range of utilities specially tailored for my dad:
- Schedule computer shutdown
- Automatically or manually fetch Polish subtitles from napiprojekt.pl
- Install OTF and TTF fonts in the system
- Convert doc, docx, odt, odf to PDF
- Merge multiple PDF files into one
- Turn [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) on or off (if installed)
- Automatically update the script via Git (if the repository has been cloned)

Unfortunately, the program is in Polish, adding a touch of linguistic charm to its functionality.

## Install

```
sudo apt install python3-dev
```
```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
